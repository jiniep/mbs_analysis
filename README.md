## Key Questions
1. What percentage of the population use MBS primary health care?
2.	Have out of pocket costs of primary health care Medicare services increased in Australia?
b.	How has usage per person and costs of the service changed?
3.	How much is an individual paying out of pocket per year (by state, gender, age, SAL3)
4.	What percentage is that of their overall earnings? Has that increased or decreased over time?
5.	What demographic is impacted the most by the cost of primary health care? Has this changed over time? Reduced or increased?
